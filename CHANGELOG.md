## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Bumped `db_image` default from `mongo:4.2` to `mongo:6.0.7` to align with the
  reference Helm chart and remove the end-of-life MongoDB 4.2 image (EOL April 2024, known CVEs).
  Operators with **persisted MongoDB volumes** must upgrade in sequence: 4.2 → 4.4 → 5.0 → 6.0.
  Fresh deployments are unaffected and can start directly on `mongo:6.0.7`.
  See `docs/variables.md` for the full migration guide. (Resolves [#124](https://github.com/anchapin/openstudio-server-nomad-pack/issues/124))

### Fixed

- Replaced phantom autoscaling variable names in README variable reference table
- Synced `packs/openstudio-server/variables.hcl`, `metadata.hcl`, and all templates under `packs/openstudio-server/templates/` to match root pack (was 20 patch versions and several variables behind). Added CI drift gate in `pack-validation.yml` that fails if `packs/` diverges from root. (#189)
  (`worker_autoscaling_min`, `worker_autoscaling_max`, `worker_autoscaling_cooldown`) with the
  correct names (`worker_min_replicas`, `worker_max_replicas`, `autoscaler_cooldown`) that match
  `variables.hcl` (resolves #123).
- Updated stale defaults in README: `worker_autoscaling_enabled` `true` → `false`,
  `worker_max_replicas` `3` → `10`, `autoscaler_cooldown` `"2m"` → `"60m"`,
  `autoscaler_prometheus_address` `""` → `"http://prometheus:9090"` (resolves #123).
- Removed `develop` and `master` from `release-version-bump.yml` `on.push.branches` so automated patch releases only fire on merges to `main`, preventing spurious public releases on every `develop` push (#192).
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` release process section to document the `develop → main` promotion flow (#192).
